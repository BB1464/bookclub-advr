# Introduction

**Learning objectives:**

- Improve programming skills 
- Deep understanding of the language fundamentals
- Understand what functional programming means

Books suggestions:

- The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs45 (SICP) 
- Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming
- The Pragmatic Programmer

## What's new?

> "The [first edition](http://adv-r.had.co.nz) used base R functions almost exclusively, this version of the book expands into more advanced functions provided by other pakages."

> "Use of new packages, particularly rlang, which provides a clean interface to low-level data structures and operations."

## Overview of the book structure


The book is composed of five sections. A step by step path towards mastering R techniques.
The **Foundations** is the part in which the R components will be examined. It will help understanding how to use all the basics tools to deal with functions and structures.
The **Functional programming** goes a little more in dept into programming with R, making functions of functions. Describing function factories and operators.
The **Object-oriented programming** - OOP is a five chapter section, all about object oriented systems among S3, R6 and S4.
The **Metaprogramming** section introduces you through the programming layers.
Finally, the **Techniques** section is dedicated to finding and fixing bugs and improving performances.

```{r dia-lib,include=FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)
```
<center>
```{r c00, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.dim="100%"}
DiagrammeR("
   graph TD
     A{Foundations}-->B(Functional programming)
     B-->C(Object-oriented programming)
     C-->D(Metaprogramming)
     D-->E(Techniques)
 ")
```
</center>


### Foundations

Six chapters to learn the foundational components of R. 
<center>
```{r c01, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.dim="100%"}
DiagrammeR("
   graph TD
     A{Foundations}-->B(Names and values)
     A-->C(Control flow)
     C-->E(Functions)
     B-->D(Vectors)
     D-->F(Subsetting)
     E-->G(Environment)
     G-->H(Conditions)
F-->H
 ")
```
</center>
The last chapter "conditions" describe errors, warnings, and messages.


### Functional programming

This part of the book is dedicated to functions: function factories and operators.

<center>
```{r c02,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.dim="100%"}
DiagrammeR("
   graph TD
     A{Functional programming}-->B(Functionals)
     B-->C(Function factories)
     B-->E(Function operators)
 ")
```
</center>

### Object-oriented programming


OOP is the most dense part of the book, as it mentions about systems which interact with R. 

<center>
```{r c03,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.dim="100%"}
DiagrammeR("
   graph TD
     A{Object-oriented programming}-->B(Base types)
     B-->C(S3)
     B-->E(R6)
     B-->D(S4)
     D-->F(Trade-offs)
     E-->F
     C-->F
")
```
</center>

### Metaprogramming

This is the part of the book where things are blended to the **Big Picture**. R is a versatile functional language that can be managed and assembled.

<center>
```{r c04,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.dim="100%"}
DiagrammeR("
   graph TD
     A{Metaprogramming}-->B(Big Picture)
     B-->C(Expressions)
     B-->E(Quasiquotation)
     B-->D(Evaluation)

     D-->F(Translating R code)
E-->F
C-->F

 ")
```
</center>


### Techniques

Finally, this is the last section of the book, where debugging is used to measure and improve performance. And how to improve performance by rewriting key functions in C++.

<center>
```{r c05,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.dim="100%"}
DiagrammeR("
   graph TD
     A{Techniques}-->B(Debugging)
     B-->C(Measuring performance)
     B-->E(Improving performance)
     C-->D(Rewriting R code in C++)
E-->D


 ")
```
