This is the best way to learn the material. Presentations will usually consist of a review of the material, a discussion, and/or a demonstration of the principles presented in that chapter. More information about how to present is available in the github repo. Presentations will be recorded, and will be available on the R4DS Online Learning Community YouTube Channel.

Develop a deep understanding of the R language fundamentals. Understand what functional programming means. For this chapter (includes the Welcome and Preface): Recognize the differences between the 1st and 2nd edition of this book. Describe the overall structure of the book. Decide whether this book is right for you.

A step by step path towards mastering R techniques. The Foundations is the part in which the R components will be examined. It will help understanding how to use all the basics tools to deal with functions and structures. The Functional programming goes a little more in dept into programming with R, making functions of functions. Describing function factories and operators. The Object-oriented programming - OOP is a five chapter section, all about object oriented systems among S3, R6 and S4. The Metaprogramming section introduces you through the programming layers. Finally, the Techniques section is dedicated to finding and fixing bugs and improving performances. 1.2.1 Foundations Six chapters to learn the foundational components of R. The last chapter ‚Äúconditions‚Äù describe errors, warnings, and messages. 1.2.2 Functional programming This part of the book is dedicated to functions: function factories and operators. 1.2.3 Object-oriented programming OOP is the most dense part of the book, as it mentions about systems which interact with R. 1.2.4 Metaprogramming This is the part of the book where things are blended to the Big Picture. R is a versatile functional language that can be managed and assembled. 1.2.5 Techniques Finally, this is the last section of the book, where debugging is used to measure and improve performance. And how to improve performance by rewriting key functions in C++.
